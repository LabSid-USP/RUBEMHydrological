   :alt: Plugin Parameters tab.

Model Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- **Interception Parameter (α)**: Mandatory float value [dimensionless quantity] that affects the daily interception threshold that depends on land use.

.. math:: 0.01 \leq \alpha \leq 10

As surface runoff is directly related to interception an optimal value can be obtained by calibration surface runoff against direct runoff separated from streamflow observations.

- **Rainfall Intensity Coefficient (b)**: Mandatory float exponent value [dimensionless quantity]  that represents the effect of rainfall intensity in the runoff.

.. math:: 0.01 \leq b \leq 1

The value is higher for low rainfall intensities resulting in less surface runoff, and approaches to one for high rainfall intensities. If :math:`b = 1`, a linear relationship is assumed between rainfall excess and soil moisture.


- **Regional Consecutive Dryness Level (RCD)**: Mandatory float value [mm] that incorporates the intensity of rain and the number of consecutive days in runoff calculation.

.. math:: 0 \leq RCD \leq 10

Where :math:`RCD = 1.0` can be used for very heavy or torrential rainfall and more than 10 consecutive rainy days/month, and :math:`RCD = 10.0` for low regional intensity rainfall less than 2 consecutive rainy days per month.

- **Flow Direction Factor (f)**: Mandatory float value [dimensionless quantity] used to partition the flow out of the root zone between interflow and flow to the saturated zone.

.. math:: 0.01 \leq f \leq 1

Where :math:`f = 1.0` corresponds to a 100% horizontal flow direction, and :math:`f = 0` corresponds to a 100% vertical flow direction.

- :raw-html:`<strong>Baseflow Recession Coefficient (α<sub>GW</sub>)</strong>`: Mandatory float value [dimensionless quantity] that relates the baseflow response to changes in groundwater recharge. 

.. math:: 0.01 \leq \alpha_{GW} \leq 1

Lower values for :math:`\alpha_{GW}` therefore correspond to areas that respond slowly to groundwater recharge, whereas higher values indicate areas that have a rapid response to groundwater recharge.


- **Flow Recession Coefficient (x)**: Mandatory float value [dimensionless quantity] that incorporates a flow delay in the accumulated amount of water that flows out of the cell into its neighboring downstream cell.

.. math:: 0 \leq x \leq 1

Where :math:`x \approx 0` corresponds to a fast responding catchment, and :math:`x \approx 1` corresponds to a slow responding catchment.

Weight Factors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- :raw-html:`<strong>Land Use Factor Weight (w<sub>1</sub>)</strong>`: Mandatory float value [dimensionless quantity] that contributes to the calculation of permeables areas runoff, and is related to Manning coefficient for each land use class. It measures the effect of the land use in the potential runoff produced. 

- :raw-html:`<strong>Soil Factor Weigh (w<sub>2</sub>)</strong>`: Mandatory float value [dimensionless quantity] that contributes to the calculation of permeables area runoff, and is related to wilting points for each soil class. It measures the effect of the soil class in the potential runoff produced.

- :raw-html:`<strong>Slope Factor Weight (w<sub>3</sub>)</strong>`: Mandatory float value [dimensionless quantity] that contributes to the calculation of permeables areas runoff, and is related to pixel slope. It measures the effect of the slope in the potential runoff produced.

:math:`w_1`, :math:`w_2` and :math:`w_3` are the weight factors for the three components contributing to the runoff coefficient for permeable areas, used in surface runoff formulation. Their sum must be equal to 1.

.. math:: w_1 + w_2 + w_3 = 1
