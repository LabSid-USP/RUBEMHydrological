Welcome to RUBEM Hydrological's documentation!
===============================================

RUBEM Hydrological is a QGIS plugin that uses `Rainfall rUnoff Balance Enhanced Model <https://github.com/LabSid-USP/RUBEM#readme>`_ to calculate monthly water balance (runoff, aquifer recharge, canopy interception and Base flow) with capabilities to consider changes in LULC over the time.

Development and maintenance of the current official version of the RUBEM Hydrological plugin for QGIS is led by the `Laboratório de Sistemas de Suporte a Decisões em Engenharia Ambiental e Recursos Hídricos (LabSid) <http://labsid.eng.br/Contato.aspx>`_ in the `Departamento de Engenharia Hidráulica e Ambiental <http://www.pha.poli.usp.br/>`_ at the `Escola Politécnica da Universidade de São Paulo <http://www.poli.usp.br/>`_. The RUBEM Hydrological plugin for QGIS is an open source development project, which means that contributions are welcome, including to the plugin documentation.
